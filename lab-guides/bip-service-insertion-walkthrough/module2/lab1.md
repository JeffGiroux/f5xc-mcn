Lab 1: Access the BIG-IP Management Interface
==========================================

1. Find the BIG-IP management interface FQDN in the XC Console.

You'll recall the FQDN was available on the [External Service Overview Dashboard](https://f5-sales-demo.console.ves.volterra.io/web/workspaces/cloud-and-edge-sites/external_services/overview/learning-week-big-ip/dashboard).
