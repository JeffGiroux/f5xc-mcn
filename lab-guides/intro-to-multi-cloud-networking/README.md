F5 Distributed Cloud - Intro to Multi-Cloud Networking
==========================================================

This Lab environment highlights some of the basic concepts of F5 Distributed Cloud (XC) Mesh using AWS and Azure public cloud environments.

During the lab, you will be emulating a customer that needs to expose an application running in AWS and Azure. The goal is to securely connect the application services between cloud environments. The frontend demo application runs on an AWS EC2 instance and is exposed to the internet. The backend demo application runs on an Azure VM instance, and it is internal only.
